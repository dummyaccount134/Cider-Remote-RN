## Build Troubleshooting

### Android SDK not found

If Expo cannot find the Android SDK, you can define `sdk.dir=<path-to-android-sdk>` in your `android/local.properties` file.

### Gradle Build Errors

Some Gradle build errors can be resolved by rebuilding caches with: 
```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease --build-cache
```
